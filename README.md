# cs361-project
Quarter long project for CS 361 Software Engineering I

As of this moment the plan is for the project to be a RPG party maker. The idea is to create a party between 3-5 people made up of various classes such as fighter, mage, healer, etc. The party maker will be able to cycle through different weapon or spell systems and give the stats of these choices. At the end you will be able to see the average stats of the party you made to see how balanced or unbalanced it is and what you need to work on. I also plan to incorporate a name randomizer to help naming your party members.

If time and skill permits, I would like to add some sort of test demo fighting a random enemy to put your party to the test using skills you have chosen.
